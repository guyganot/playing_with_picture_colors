 * Demonstrates the morphing service of Instush.java. 
 * The program recieves three command-line arguments: the name of a PPM file
 * that represents the source image (a string), the name of a PPM file that represents
 * the target image (a string), and the number of morphing steps (an int). 
 * For example:
 * java Editor3 cake.ppm ironman.ppm 300
 * If the two images don't have the same dimensions, the program scales the target image
 * to the dimensions of the source image.
